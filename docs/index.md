# CloudWeGo API Documentation

This site contains the documentation for using CloudWeGo API Gateway.

## Introduction

CloudWeGo API Gateway is a high-performance API Gateway built on top of [Kitex](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex)
and [Hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz).

The API Gateway can handle JSON-encoded HTTP requests and utilize Kitex's `Generic-Call` feature to convert these requests into `Thrift` binary format.

For more information on installation, see the [Setup](/setup) section.
