# Observability

## Setup

To enable observability and gain valuable insights into the API Gateway's behavior and performance, follow these steps.

Open a terminal and navigate to the observability directory in your project:

```shell
$ cd observability
```

Start the necessary services using Docker Compose:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
WARN[0000] The "OTELCOL_ARGS" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.

## Traces

To view the traces generated by API requests, open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).
This URL will take you to the [Jaeger UI](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), where you can explore distributed traces and identify potential bottlenecks or latency issues.

## Metrics

To visualize and analyze various metrics, including request rates, latencies, and error rates, access the [Grafana](https://grafana.com) UI.
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Add data source

Follow the `kitex-example` [guide](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex-examples/blob/main/opentelemetry/README.md#add-datasource)
on adding a data source.

## Import dashboard

After setting up the data source, you can import the provided `dashboard.json` file to visualize the API Gateway's key metrics.
This dashboard basic overview of system performance and resource utilisation.
